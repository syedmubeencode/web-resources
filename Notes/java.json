Java uses a compiler to create bytecode and the JVM to interpret/compile it at runtime.<br/><br/><b><span style='color:red;'>Q: Is the JIT compiler different from the regular compiler?</span></b><br/><b>Ans:</b> Yes. The regular compiler (javac) creates bytecode before execution. The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler converts bytecode to native machine code during runtime to improve performance.<br/><br/><b><span style='color:red;'>Q: Explain Java's platform independence.</span></b><br/><b>Ans:</b> Java compiles source code into platform-neutral bytecode (.class files). Any system with a JVM can execute this bytecode, regardless of the underlying hardware or OS.<br/><br/><b><span style='color:red;'>Q: What is bytecode in Java?</span></b><br/><b>Ans:</b> Bytecode is a machine-independent instruction set contained in .class files. It serves as the intermediate step between Java source code and machine-specific code, executed only by the JVM.</p>"

An interpreter, on the other hand, translates and executes the code line by line, making it easier to debug but slower in execution. In Java, the compiler converts code to bytecode, and the JVM interpreter executes it.<br/><br/><b><span style='color:red;'>Q: Is Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler and compiler different? If not, then what are those?</span></b><br/><b>Ans:</b> The regular compiler converts Java source code into bytecode, which the JVM can understand. The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, part of the JVM, further converts this bytecode into native machine code at runtime to boost performance. So, both are compilers but work at different stages — one before execution and the other during execution.<br/><br/><b><span style='color:red;'>Q: JVM is platform independent where JDK is not — please explain?</span></b><br/><b>Ans:</b> Java's most unique feature is its platform independence. Unlike other languages that compile source code into platform-specific executables, Java compiles code into .class files containing bytecode. This bytecode is interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is available on all major platforms. As a result, Java code compiled on Windows can run on Linux or any other platform with a JVM.<br/><br/><b><span style='color:red;'>Q: What is bytecode in Java?</span></b><br/><b>Ans:</b> When a javac compiler compiles a class, it generates a .class file. This .class file contains a set of instructions called bytecode. Bytecode is a machine-independent language and contains instructions that are executed only by the JVM. The JVM can understand and execute these bytecodes.<br/><br/></p>"
